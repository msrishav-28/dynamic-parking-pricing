# Dynamic Parking Pricing Model Analysis Report

## Introduction

This report details the development and analysis of dynamic pricing models for parking lots, leveraging historical occupancy, traffic, and special event data. The objective is to optimize parking prices to maximize revenue while managing demand effectively.

## Data Analysis and Preprocessing

The provided dataset contains information on various parking lots, including capacity, occupancy, vehicle types, traffic conditions, queue lengths, and special day indicators. Initial data exploration revealed no missing values, and data types were appropriate for analysis. The `LastUpdatedDate` and `LastUpdatedTime` columns were combined and converted to datetime objects for time-series analysis.

Key features engineered for the models include:
- **Occupancy Rate**: Calculated as `Occupancy / Capacity`.
- **VehicleTypeWeight**: A numerical representation of vehicle types (e.g., car: 1.0, bike: 0.5, truck: 1.5).
- **TrafficConditionWeight**: A numerical representation of traffic conditions (e.g., low: 0.5, average: 1.0, high: 1.5).

## Pricing Models Developed

Three distinct pricing models were developed and analyzed:

### Model 1: Baseline Linear Model

This model proposes a simple linear adjustment to a base price based on the occupancy rate. The price for the next time step is calculated as: 

`Pricet+1 = Pricet + α · (Occupancy / Capacity)`

Where `Pricet` is the current price, and `α` is a sensitivity parameter. This model serves as a basic benchmark for comparison.

### Model 2: Demand-Based Price Function

This model incorporates multiple factors influencing demand to determine the optimal price. The demand is calculated as:

`Demand = α·(Occupancy/Capacity) + β·QueueLength − γ·Traffic + δ·IsSpecialDay + ε·VehicleTypeWeight`

Where `α, β, γ, δ, ε` are coefficients representing the impact of each factor. The price is then derived from this normalized demand:

`Pricet = BasePrice · (1 + λ · NormalizedDemand)`

This model aims to capture a more comprehensive view of pricing dynamics by considering various demand drivers.

### Model 3: Competitive Pricing Model

This advanced model extends Model 2 by incorporating the influence of nearby competitor parking lots. It considers the geographic proximity of other lots and their average prices to adjust the current lot's price. The Haversine formula was used to calculate distances between parking lots. The model adjusts prices based on the difference between the current lot's Model 2 price and the average competitor price within a defined influence radius, with a sensitivity factor. This model aims to ensure competitive pricing strategies.

## Visualizations and Insights

Several visualizations were generated to understand the behavior of the models and the impact of various factors on pricing.

### Price Comparison Over Time

This plot illustrates how the prices generated by each of the three models evolve over time for a specific parking lot. It allows for a direct comparison of their dynamic adjustments.

### Impact of Occupancy Rate on Model 2 Price

This scatter plot shows the relationship between the occupancy rate and the price generated by Model 2. As expected, higher occupancy rates generally lead to higher prices, reflecting increased demand.

### Impact of Queue Length on Model 2 Price

This scatter plot visualizes the effect of queue length on Model 2 prices. Longer queues indicate higher demand, which in turn results in increased prices.

### Distribution of Prices for Each Model

These histograms show the distribution of prices generated by each model across the entire dataset. This helps in understanding the range and frequency of prices set by each model.

### Price Distribution by Vehicle Type (Model 2)

This box plot illustrates how Model 2 prices vary across different vehicle types. It highlights the impact of the `VehicleTypeWeight` feature on pricing.

### Price Distribution by Traffic Condition Nearby (Model 2)

This box plot shows the variation in Model 2 prices based on nearby traffic conditions. Higher traffic conditions generally lead to higher prices due to increased demand and reduced availability.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The dynamic pricing models developed demonstrate the feasibility of adjusting parking prices based on real-time and historical data. Model 3, the Competitive Pricing Model, offers the most sophisticated approach by considering both internal demand factors and external competitive influences. 

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Parameter Tuning**: The coefficients (`α, β, γ, δ, ε, λ`) in Model 2 and the `influence_radius`, `price_sensitivity` in Model 3 should be further optimized using historical revenue data and A/B testing in a real-world scenario.
2.  **Real-time Data Integration**: For true dynamic pricing, real-time data feeds for occupancy, queue length, traffic, and competitor prices are crucial.
3.  **Predictive Analytics**: Incorporate predictive elements to forecast demand and occupancy, allowing for proactive price adjustments.
4.  **User Experience**: Consider the impact of frequent price changes on user experience and implement strategies to communicate pricing clearly.
5.  **Robustness Testing**: Test the models under various simulated scenarios, including extreme demand fluctuations and competitor strategies, to ensure robustness.
